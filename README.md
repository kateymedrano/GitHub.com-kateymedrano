Katey Medrano – Aspiring Data Scientist | Biology & Analytics
Hi there 👋
I'm Katey Medrano, a quantitative-minded Biology student transitioning into Data Science. My focus is on applying Python, SQL, and statistical modeling to extract meaningful, evidence-based insights and drive better decisions.
I am particularly self-directed and eager to learn new tools quickly (a critical trait for the Data Science Intern role) and aim to translate complex data models into concise, actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.
⭐️ Featured Projects (Showcasing Core Data Science Skills)
1. Predictive Health Modeling & Visualization
Explored relationships in patient data to build foundational predictive models.
• Used Python (pandas, scikit-learn) to perform regression analysis to identify correlation patterns between glucose levels and lifestyle factors.
• Developed visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) to clearly present findings and patterns in diet and activity data.
2. Statistical Inference and Machine Learning Practice
A dedicated notebook to applying core statistical methods and machine learning concepts.
• Implemented statistical inference tests (t-tests, ANOVA) to validate assumptions and measure outcome significance.
• Practiced foundational classification and predictive modeling techniques, directly relevant to the role’s requirement for familiarity with basic ML concepts.
3. Analytical Data Summarization & Dashboarding
A project demonstrating end-to-end data analysis, from query to summarization.
• Utilized SQL and Python to query, clean, and summarize public air quality data.
• Focused on generating data-driven summaries and trend analyses designed for easy consumption by product or operational teams.
Technical Skills
• Languages: Python, SQL
• Core Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
• Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Excel
• Data Workflow Concepts: Familiarity with Cloud Data Platforms (Snowflake) and Data Transformation principles (dbt/Airbyte concepts), ready to learn CI/CD workflows.
• Statistical Concepts: Regression, Classification, Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization.
Career Goal:
To contribute as a Data Scientist in an environment that values learning and ownership, applying rigorous experiments and measurable KPIs to real-world business challenges, and shaping the foundation of data-informed decisions.
