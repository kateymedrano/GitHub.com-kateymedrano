# Katey Medrano – Aspiring Data Scientist | Biology & Analytics

Hello there!  
I'm Katey Medrano, a quantitative-minded Biology student transitioning into Data Science. My focus is on applying Python, SQL, and statistical modeling to extract meaningful, evidence-based insights and drive better decisions.

I am particularly self-directed and eager to learn new tools quickly (a critical trait for the Data Science Intern role) and aim to translate complex data models into concise, actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.

## Featured Projects (Showcasing Core Data Science Skills)

### 1. Predictive Health Modeling & Visualization
Explored relationships in patient data to build foundational predictive models.  
- Used Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`) to perform regression analysis identifying correlation patterns between glucose levels and lifestyle factors.  
- Developed visualizations (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to clearly present findings and patterns in diet and activity data.  

### 2. Statistical Inference and Machine Learning Practice
A dedicated notebook to applying core statistical methods and machine learning concepts.  
- Implemented statistical inference tests (t-tests, ANOVA) to validate assumptions and measure outcome significance.  
- Practiced foundational classification and predictive modeling techniques, directly relevant to basic ML concepts.  

### 3. Analytical Data Summarization & Dashboarding
Demonstrates end-to-end data analysis, from query to summarization.  
- Utilized SQL and Python to query, clean, and summarize public air quality data.  
- Generated data-driven summaries and trend analyses designed for easy consumption by product or operational teams.
